## Hi, i'm Jules Girardon üëÄ

Bonjour! I am currently a student at the IUT du Puy-en-Velay and my ambition is to become a software developer. I have had an interest in the field of IT for a long time (in fact since I got my first computer...) and I love what I do! Here you will find everything I do, from software development to research in artificial intelligence and digital imaging. Have a nice visit! ‚úàÔ∏è
